Run 'npm i' to install all the dependencies. 

To run the Express server create config/config.js with the contents as in configTemplate.js. Modify it with your MongoDB details and the port you wish to run it on. Start the server by 'npm run startAPI'. 

To run the React App in development mode. Head to src/config/config.js and add the URL to the Express server within ''. Then run 'npm start'. The React App by default runs on localhost:3000, hence run the Express Server on a different port (like 8080).
